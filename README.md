# Smart Contracts with Solidity

In this project, I program three contracts for hypothetical compensation arrangements that may be set up by a company HR:

- `AssociateProfitSplitter` contract that accepts ETH into the contract and divides it evenly among associate-level employees. This will allow the human resources department to pay employees quickly and efficiently. 

- `TieredProfitSplitter` contract that distributes different percentages of incoming ETH to employees at different tiers/levels. For example, the CEO gets paid 60%, CTO 25%, and Bob gets 15%.

- `DeferredEquityPlan` contract that models traditional company stock plans. This contract will automatically manage 1000 shares, with an annual distribution of 250 shares over four years for a single employee.
