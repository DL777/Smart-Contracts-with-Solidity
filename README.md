# Smart Contracts with Solidity

In this project, I programmed three contracts for hypothetical compensation arrangements that may be set up by a company HR:

- `AssociateProfitSplitter` contract that accepts ETH into the contract and divides it evenly among associate-level employees. This will allow the human resources department to pay employees quickly and efficiently. 

- `TieredProfitSplitter` contract that distributes different percentages of incoming ETH to employees at different tiers/levels. For example, the CEO gets paid 60%, CTO 25%, and Bob gets 15%.

- `DeferredEquityPlan` contract that models traditional company stock plans. This contract will automatically manage 1000 shares, with an annual distribution of 250 shares over four years for a single employee.

# Associate Profit Splitter

This hypothetical contract is setup to facilitate the payment to three associate-level employees who are all paid the equal share of all ETH transferred into the contract. The contract can be scaled up to facilitate the payments to a large group of employees. 

The Solidity code is shown in this screenshot:

The contract was originally deployed in `Remix` on my local  `Ganache` chain by connecting to `Injected Web3` and ensuring `MetaMask` is pointed to `localhost:8545`.


This contract was deployed from my `Account 4` on my local `Ganache` chain and my `Account 1`, `Account 2` and `Account 3` were designated as `employee_one`, `employee_two` and `employee_three` respectively.

Here is the screenshot of the balance in my `Account 4` (HR) and my "employee" accounts before the the deposit of funds:

I booked a deposit transaction for ETH 30:

And the balances in my accounts changed accordingly:

- The balance in Account 4 decreased by ETH30 and 
- The balances in my Account1, Account 2 and Account 3 increased by ETH 10 each:

Following this, I deployed `AssociateProfitSplitter` contract on `Ropsten Test Network`:

# Tiered Profit Splitter

This hypothetical contract is setup to facilitate the payments to three employees of different seniority who are paid different percentages of incoming ETH payments. In this example the employees are:

- The CEO, who gets paid 60%, 
- The CTO, who gets paid 25% and
- Bob, who gets paid 15%.

The Solidity code is shown in this screenshot:

Just like in the first contract, I first set up the contract on my local chain and then deployed it on ‘Ropsten Test Network`.

This contract was deployed from my `Account 4` on my local `Ganache` chain and my `Account 1`, `Account 2` and `Account 3` were designated as `employee_one (CEO)`, `employee_two (CTO)` and `employee_three (Bob)` respectively.

- The balance in my Account1 increased by ETH 18,
- The balance in my Account 2 increased by ETH 7.5,
- The balance in my Account 3 increased by ETH 4.5.

# Deferred Equity Plan

This contract is design to facilitate the administration of a deferred equity compensation plan. In this contract, an employee gets awarded 1000 shares as part of her/his compensation and those shares are vested over the next 4 years in equal shares of 25% (250 shares) per year.

The Solidity code is shown in this screenshot:

![Contract1](Screenshots/c3.png)

Just like for the previous two contracts, I first set up the contract on my local chain and then deployed it on ‘Ropsten Test Network`.

In this contract, `msg.sender` if HR who are deploying the contract. 
At the start of the contract, the employee needs to be employed (`bool active = true`).

The employee is awarded the total of 1000 shares (`uint total_shares = 1000`).

Out of the total number of shares, 250 are vested annually (`uint annual_distribution = 250`).

The contract records the time when it’s activated (`uint start_time = now`)
Once the annual distribution is done, the contract then locks for a year. This is managed by the variable `uin unlock_time = now + 365 days`.

Function `distribute` requires that:

- Only HR or the employee can execute the contract ` require(msg.sender == human_resources || msg.sender == employee)`
- The employee still be employed `require(active == true)`
- The current time is past the unlock time ` require(unlock_time <= now)`
- The sum of all annual distributions can’t exceed the total number of shares awarded ` require(distributed_shares < total_shares)`.

The local deployment of this contract is done as follows:

- For this contract, we test the timelock functionality by adding a new variable called `uint fakenow = now;` as the first line of the contract, then replace every other instance of `now` with `fakenow`. 

- We utilize the following `fastforward` function to manipulate `fakenow` during testing.


- For example, you can add this function to "fast forward" time by 100 days when the contract is deployed (requires setting up `fakenow`):

`function fastforward() public {
    fakenow += 100 days;
}`


- Once you are satisfied with your contract's logic, revert the `fakenow` testing logic.



Following the testing on local network with `fastforward` function, I deployed `TieredProfitSplitter` contract on `Ropsten Test Network`:
